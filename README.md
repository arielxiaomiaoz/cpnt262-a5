My biggest problem is that Heroku page doesn't work as fine as my localhost works. I redeploied for couple times, modiefied my files comparing with Tony's, modified some detials, but still doesn't work. I started to watch the video of Week10T, finally I found out that I forgot to set the Heroku config Vars. After setting, everything wokrs fine!

Except Tony's video, I also reviewed some sample code by my instructor Tony Grimes.
